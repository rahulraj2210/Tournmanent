**Racing Tournament Facilitator:

Hello and welcome the tournament!

CrioLand is famous for itâ€™s racing events. Every year the finale of racing events is organised. This year due to the pandemic, the event was cancelled. So, this time the governor of CrioLand decided to have a virtual contest. The winner of the contest is the one with the fastest car.

Each team has some brands of cars already present in their garage. Each team has a maximum amount of funds that they can spend. Each car will have certain spare parts that can be attached to the car. These spare parts will give a speed boost but come with a cost. 

For each team, given the list of cars and parts, you have to decide which car will be selected and which spare part will be added to the car such that maximum speed is achieved in the given budget.

Then we finally print the car name, team name, and the id of each of the spare parts attached to the car that can go the fastest in the race!
